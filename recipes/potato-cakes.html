            <li>
                Mix mashed potatoes, flour, onion, egg, black pepper, and salt in a bowl until well combined, 
                similar to a batter consistency.
            </li>

            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop 4-inch circles of batter into the hot oil. 
                Cook until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side; drain on paper towels. Repeat with any remaining batter.
